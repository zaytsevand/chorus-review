# Chorus SDLC (lifecycle mode)

This skill is the **lifecycle-mode** member of the chorus suite. Where the
project-state round (`chorus-review`) orchestrates one review of a chosen scope,
this skill orchestrates a whole **speckit spec lifecycle** — interleaving speckit
phase-runners with three scoped **chorus gates** (design, plan/tasks,
implementation). Each gate runs the four-stage primitive in
`chorus-core/GATE-PRIMITIVE.md`.

It composes the shared substrate skill **`chorus-core`** by name and is
**independent of `chorus-review`** — it shares no file with the review skill and
no reference here resolves into it (FR-006). The Dijkstra posture is the
substrate's, applied one level up the hierarchy: the SDLC orchestrator routes
between speckit phase-runners, the personas, and the operator; it audits that
each gate fired honestly; it refuses to author artefacts or to pass a 🔴
silently.

## REQUIRED: chorus-core — substrate guard (run BEFORE anything else)

This skill composes **`chorus-core`**. Before relying on **any** core mechanic —
the four-stage gate (`GATE-PRIMITIVE.md`), the decision banding
(`DECISION-PRIMITIVE.md`), the exploratory phase (`EXPLORATORY-PHASE.md`), or the
conductor discipline + `I1–I9` invariant catalog (`CONDUCTOR.md`) — the calling
session MUST assert that the `chorus-core` skill directory is reachable (its four
files are present).

The skill loader does **not** enforce the `REQUIRED:` marker (it is advisory), so
this assertion is the real enforcement. **If `chorus-core` is not reachable, STOP
and fail loudly** — do not improvise the missing mechanics, do not degrade
silently. Emit:

> **chorus-core is missing.** `chorus-sdlc` requires the shared substrate skill
> `chorus-core`, which is not reachable. This means a broken or partial install of
> the chorus suite — the shared mechanics (the four-stage gate, decision banding,
> exploratory phase, and the `I1–I9` invariant catalog) cannot be loaded, so the
> lifecycle gates cannot run honestly. **Recovery:** re-install the chorus suite
> (`./install.sh`), or check that `chorus-core` was published/copied under its
> expected name, then retry.

When `chorus-core` is reachable, its router (`chorus-core/SKILL.md`) runs its own
reachability self-check over the four files (defense-in-depth for the
file-missing case). This guard does **not** reference `chorus-review` in any way;
the lifecycle runs with the review skill absent.

## Position in the system

The SDLC orchestrator sits one level above the round orchestrator.

- **Level N+1 — the operator.** Holds project goals, scope decisions, sign-off.
  The orchestrator talks to the operator in the language of *procedure*: phase,
  gate, 🔴, waiver, escalation. It never decides for the operator.
- **Level N — the speckit phase-runners and the gates.** The orchestrator invokes
  `/speckit-specify | clarify | plan | tasks | implement` to produce artefacts,
  and convenes gates to review them. It authors **nothing** itself.
- **Level N-1 — the personas**, dispatched per gate through the primitive.

## The pipeline

A single SDLC run drives one feature, in this order. The orchestrator never
merges or skips a step (S-ordering / FR-002).

```mermaid

    plan["/speckit-plan → plan.md"] --> A{"Gate A · design review"}
    A -->|"🔴 incorporate: /speckit-clarify → /speckit-plan"| A

    C -->|clear| mem["memory update · dispatch each seated lens write-back (sign-off bookend)"]
    mem --> done([feature reviewed · memory updated])
```

The feature's spec is the entry point, not a step the orchestrator must author:
a prior `/speckit-specify` (and optional `/speckit-clarify`) may have produced
it, or it may already exist. The gates begin at `/speckit-plan`.

There is **no acceptance gate**. Because the implementation hews to a plan and
tasks that were themselves reviewed (Gates A, B), the deviation surface is small;
a success-criteria acceptance pass over it is low-yield. Gate C reviews the
code's **own soundness** (bugs, drift, quality), which is where residual risk
lives.

## Gate mechanics

Every gate runs the four-stage primitive (`chorus-core/GATE-PRIMITIVE.md`:
extract → uncapped author → real vote → deterministic tally). The lifecycle layer
adds seating, gating, incorporation, and bound.

**Operator-facing decisions** in this layer — seating, block-on-🔴, gate sign-off —
are banded by the **decision primitive** (`chorus-core/DECISION-PRIMITIVE.md`: 🟢
auto-resolve / 🟡 proceed-with-recorded-default + async override / 🔴 hard-block +
instant ask, by **declared catalog predicate**, never orchestrator inference). The
sections below reference that mechanic; they do not restate it. The point is a
**self-unblocking yet balanced** lifecycle: the workflow runs forward, stopping the
operator only for 🔴.

### RSVP and seating (per gate)

- RSVP fires **independently at every gate**. A persona's JOIN/ABSTAIN at one
  gate never carries to another (S2). Goldratt may abstain on a code
  review yet join the design gate; a language lens abstains when its language is
  not in scope.
- Each JOIN reply carries the **two-axis signal** (`chorus-core/DECISION-PRIMITIVE.md`
  §RSVP signal): **applicability** (≥1 cited round-context delta the lens touches; an
  un-cited JOIN is not-applicable) and **expected stakes** (🟢/🟡/🔴-potential + a
  hook). This replaces the old single relevance 0–3 score, which degenerated to
  all-3s.
- **Ordinary seating** is a *decision* banded by `chorus-core/DECISION-PRIMITIVE.md`
  (catalog rows 1–2): the cap is **5 ordinary (JOIN) seats**. `3 ≤ J ≤ 5` → seat all.
  `J ≥ 6` → sort by (applicability, then expected stakes); a **strict** order at the
  5th seat is 🟢 (auto-seat). A **tie** spanning the 5th seat is **🟡** — seat a recorded
  default panel and queue it for async override, **never an operator interruption** (this
  is the seating tie that parked feature 005 tried, and failed, to resolve mechanically;
  as a 🟡 it self-unblocks). `J < 3` → re-ping once; abort the gate honestly on the second
  failure. The orchestrator still never judges lens merit (S3/D1) — it sorts
  persona-supplied evidence and applies a declared band.
- **Exceptional entry** (uncapped, rare): a lens may enter *beyond* the 5 ordinary seats
  via an **exceptional-reasoning entry** — an RSVP answer that **cites a concrete
  round-context delta no seated ordinary lens covers**. The bar is **evidence, not an
  adjudicator**: the cited delta is held to the same rule as any RSVP signal — an
  un-anchored "I'm exceptional" claim is **refused** (I8/D5); distinct entries must cite
  **distinct** uncovered deltas (duplicate-delta claims do not each earn a seat, which
  self-limits packing). **No actor approves** the entry (self-selection preserved — no
  operator-pin, no mandate); a lens that cannot articulate an uncovered delta has not
  demonstrated value, and not seating it is the bar working, not exclusion. An
  exceptional seat confers a **voice, not weight** — its vote counts exactly as an
  ordinary seat's (severity stays arithmetic, `chorus-core/GATE-PRIMITIVE.md` Stage 4).
  Seated board size = `min(roster, min(5, |ordinary JOIN|) + |exceptional|)`; the board
  never exceeds the roster. Exceptional entries (with cited deltas) and the
  ordinary/exceptional split are recorded in the ledger. Because the exceptional path is
  always open, the ordinary cap keeps boards small and legible without ever *truly*
  excluding articulated value.
- **Mandate guardrail**: when the cap forces an ordinary out-seat, "covered by a seated
  lens" is judged by **mandate, not by overlapping findings** — one shared finding does
  not transfer a lens's role.
- **The scope/deferral lens secures its seat by exceptional entry, not a bespoke
  mandate.** A new buildout always presents an uncovered **scope/deferral delta** (the
  cut — no other lens holds that mandate), so the scope/deferral lens (Goldratt)
  **exceptional-enters** by citing it and, being uncapped, is never out-seated by the
  cap — the same evidence-gated path any lens uses, not a hard carve-out. This replaces
  the former "Goldratt is never out-seated on a new buildout" rule: the carve-out existed
  because the *cap* could force the scope lens out (issue #6 — a 2026-06-11 gate
  out-seated it as "covered", and the operator had to perform the cut by hand);
  uncapped exceptional entry removes that root cause for every lens, so the special-case
  is retired. **Safety net** (not a mandate): if a **new-buildout gate is seated without
  the scope/deferral lens**, the conductor files a side-note for the operator
  (`chorus-core/CONDUCTOR.md` § Side-notes) — flag-only, never an auto-seat.

Expected (not enforced) attendance: **Gate A** — product, architecture,
delivery-and-ops, security, + Goldratt (scope/defer); **Cooper mandatory** when
the corpus defers cross-user value, shared reuse, or trust promotion
(`chorus-core/DEFERRAL-CHECKLIST.md`, project addendum §12). **Gates B/C** —
architecture, domain, language lens (if code in scope), delivery-and-ops,
security.

### Gate A corpus checks (value-first — before Author stage)

The orchestrator verifies the gate corpus **before** seated lenses author findings:

1. **Outcome & Stage-1 proof** present in `spec.md` (not placeholder)
2. **plan.md** includes **Principle XI side-effect inventory** when the spec names
   queue polling, GET queue endpoints, or scheduler/fill jobs
   (`chorus-core/CONSTITUTION-PREVIEW.md`)
3. Every **DEFERRED** capability has a complete row in the spec's deferral checklist
   (`chorus-core/DEFERRAL-CHECKLIST.md`)
4. **Cooper** is seated when any deferral row is cross-user / reuse (no ABSTAIN)

Missing (1)–(3) is gating 🔴-potential for Goldratt (FR-before-verdict) and may
block incorporation until the spec is corrected via `/speckit-clarify`.

### Gate B design checks (value-first)

- Trust / promotion / cross-user fields in `data-model.md` or OpenAPI require a
  **non-deferred** parent FR that consumes them; otherwise 🔴 anti-theater
- Queue/poll designs must match the plan XI inventory (no undeclared GET writes)

### Incorporation rules (deferral checklist)

When incorporation resolves a deferral or anti-theater finding:

1. Revise **`spec.md` first** — add or complete deferral-checklist rows (S5)
2. Regenerate `plan.md` / `data-model.md` via `/speckit-plan` — remove dormant trust
   columns if parent FR stays DEFERRED
3. Re-seat **Cooper** on cross-user/reuse deferrals before re-running Gate A

### Exploratory phase (per gate)

After seating and **before the gate's Author stage** (`chorus-core/GATE-PRIMITIVE.md`
stage 2), each seated lens runs the **exploratory phase**
(`chorus-core/EXPLORATORY-PHASE.md`): it builds a persisted, lens-specific
understanding of the gate's corpus, harvesting **reference-first** (addendum first)
and re-grounding findings in live material (persisted memory is an index, never the
evidentiary endpoint). The **project base is reused across gates** — built once, each
gate adds only feature/spec deltas — so Gates B and C do not re-derive the project
context Gate A established. Gap-questions feed the orchestrator's **one batched,
sessioned operator interview** (≤ 5 Q/session, re-entrant, operator-paced; a deferred
session yields a verdict degradation summary); project-wide answers are written back
to the addendum (operator-accepted). **Unmet `[gate]` needs lead session 1**: each
seated lens prompts for the answers it has declared it cannot honestly review without
(who the user is and how many, the grading bar, the characteristic ranking) before
findings are authored — and keeps its gates and their standing answers current in its
memory record (`chorus-core/EXPLORATORY-PHASE.md` § Gate upkeep). The phase feeds
Stage 1 Extract; it does not replace it.

### Block on 🔴 — via the self-heal loop

A post-tally gating 🔴 is a **decision** banded by `chorus-core/DECISION-PRIMITIVE.md`
(catalog row 5, the self-heal loop):

- While `cycle < 3` it is a **🟡 decision**: the orchestrator **auto-runs the
  incorporation cascade and re-runs the gate** (the re-run tally is the verifying
  sensor — "verify before you ask"), emitting an `in-progress` DecisionRecord **before
  each next cycle** so an in-flight self-heal reads as progress, not runaway.
- It **escalates to a 🔴 operator ask** at `cycle == 3` without clearing, **or** when a
  **waiver** of a real concern is the only path. A waiver is never applied
  automatically; 🔴 never auto-proceeds (D2).
- 🟡/🟢 findings are recorded; the operator proceeds at will. N+1 holds sign-off (S4).
- This stays inside the existing guarantees: **S4** (the 🔴 is *resolved and verified*,
  never passed silently), **S5** (spec-sourced incorporation), **S7** (the 3-cycle
  bound is the escalation trigger). It just stops asking the operator to push the
  incorporate button each cycle.

### Vote dispatch (S8/S9)

When the gate reaches stage 3, the orchestrator dispatches the vote to the
seated personas **excluding each finding's author** for that finding (S8). Votes
are real dispatches; the orchestrator never predicts, infers, or synthesizes a
vote or a grade (S9). The gating 🔴 set is the output of the deterministic stage-4
tally over those real votes — not an orchestrator opinion. (S8/S9 are defined in
`chorus-core/GATE-PRIMITIVE.md`.)

### Incorporation loop

The **spec is the source of truth**. A 🔴 is resolved by revising the spec and
regenerating downstream artefacts via speckit — never by hand-patching a
downstream artefact (S5):

- **Gate A**: `/speckit-clarify` → `/speckit-plan`.
- **Gate B**: `/speckit-clarify` → `/speckit-plan` → `/speckit-tasks`.
- **Gate C**: a direct code fix for a code defect, or `/speckit-clarify` →
  re-implement when the finding is a spec gap.

After each pass the gate **re-runs** (a fresh RSVP + primitive cycle).

### Loop bound

Each gate's incorporation loop is bounded at **N = 3 cycles**. After the third
cycle without clearing its 🔴, the orchestrator **stops and escalates to the
operator** rather than looping indefinitely (S7).

### Fixed viewpoint — `spec-walkthrough` (Gate C)

At **Gate C** the orchestrator invokes the installed skill headless —
`Skill(skill: "spec-walkthrough", args: "<NNN> headless")` — and ingests the
returned digest (handle-keyed traceability matrix, DRIFT/SURPRISE list, GAP
count) as stage-1 extract records with `source: "spec-walkthrough"`. It is **not
gospel** (FR-018): each item must be authored into a finding by a persona to face
the vote, a persona may contradict it, and any DRIFT/SURPRISE no persona claims
is logged as an unclaimed record (visible, non-gating). Gate B invokes it only
when substantial pre-existing code is in scope to reconcile against. (Its job is
spec↔code reconciliation, so it is empty on a greenfield pre-implementation
gate.)

### Memory update phase (sign-off)

Once per lifecycle, **after Gate C clears and as the sign-off bookend**, the orchestrator
runs the **memory update phase** — the write-side counterpart to the exploratory phase's
read-side (`chorus-core/EXPLORATORY-PHASE.md`). Where the exploratory phase *reads* each
lens's understanding before a gate, this phase *writes back* what the cycle taught, so the
next run starts from the last run's understanding instead of re-deriving it (spec 010). It
does **not** fire per gate, per self-heal cycle, or on a run aborted before sign-off (010
FR-001).

It reuses the exploratory phase's write-back contract and invents **no new write path**
(Principle I):

- **Dispatch, never synthesize (S1/S9).** The orchestrator **dispatches each seated persona**
  to update **its own** `.claude/agent-memory/<persona>/` record; it authors no record and
  synthesizes no learning. Each lens distills **only its own contributions to this run's ledger**
  (its findings-register rows + its understanding record) — a re-read of its own prior output, not
  a fresh harvest. (The cheaper "orchestrator distills the whole ledger in one pass" alternative is
  refused: it would synthesize what a lens learned — 010 TOC-3.)
- **Durable-only (010 FR-003a).** A learning persists **iff** it (a) carries a re-groundable
  locator into a live source **and** (b) generalizes beyond this run's spec delta. Persisted text is
  a **locator + ≤~2-sentence hint**, never a standalone verdict ("memory is an index, never the
  endpoint").
- **Secret pre-filter first (010 FR-007).** An **agent-applied, ledger-audited** deny-filter runs on
  **every** candidate fact **before** any record write or proposal, independent of the operator-confirm.
  Its detector class is **two-part**: credential-shaped secrets (high-entropy tokens, known
  credential/key prefixes, `.env`/secret-file path captures) **and** structured private project facts
  (internal hostnames, personal/customer names, ticket IDs — the constitution's boundary is broader
  than credentials, and low-entropy private prose sails past an entropy check). Matches are dropped and
  flagged in the ledger on **both** paths (the `project-wide` proposal path **and** the auto
  `lens-specific` write path). The secrets boundary is absolute and does not ride on the confirm —
  but because the skill has **no runtime**, this is **persona-applied discipline made verifiable by the
  ledger drop-record**, not a "mechanical" runtime pass; the ledger audit, not the label, is the guard.
- **Scope routing, banded by `chorus-core/DECISION-PRIMITIVE.md`.**
  - **`lens-specific` facts → mechanically-decidable → 🟢 auto.** Each persona writes them to its own
    record (the exploratory-phase fact, written at sign-off).
  - **`project-wide` facts → operator-owned → surfaced, never auto-written.** The orchestrator
    **collates a single accept/reject diff** to `docs/reviews/CHORUS-PROJECT.md`'s "Project
    understanding" section — the existing scope-tagged, operator-accepted write-back (spec 004
    FR-005/FR-017), not a new path. **Accept** applies it; **reject** discards it (a DecisionRecord is
    written, default = addendum unchanged); **no-response** defers it — the proposal is queued in the
    ledger's pending list and re-offered at the next sign-off, never silently lost. The re-offer is
    **bounded (010 FR-006): after N = 3 unanswered sign-offs the proposal lapses** to a
    passively-readable pending list — a terminal state, no longer actively re-offered (so "defer" never
    becomes a standing tax that re-asks forever). The addendum stays byte-unchanged unless the operator
    accepts, and **sign-off is never blocked** on the answer (self-unblocking discipline, spec 006).
- **No-op is recorded (010 FR-009).** With no durable learnings, or for a persona with no memory dir,
  the phase records a no-op **naming which test produced it** (no locator / does-not-generalize / no
  memory dir) — it never fabricates a record or surfaces an empty proposal.

The phase records its outcome in the ledger under `## Memory update (sign-off)` (below), and the
end-of-run self-audit gains the check "orchestrator authored no record / synthesized no learning."

## Invariants (lifecycle level)

These **extend** the core-resident `I1–I9` catalog (defined once in
`chorus-core/CONDUCTOR.md`) — they reference those tokens and do not redefine
them. S8/S9/S10 are gate-primitive-level and live in
`chorus-core/GATE-PRIMITIVE.md`; the lifecycle tokens `S1–S7` are defined here.

- **S1.** The orchestrator authors no spec/plan/tasks/code itself; every artefact
  change traces to a speckit phase-runner. (Extends I1.)
- **S2.** RSVP fires independently at each gate; no JOIN/ABSTAIN carries across
  gates. (Extends I2.)
- **S3.** No **ordinary** panel exceeds 5; ordinary overflow is seated by the
  persona-declared two-axis signal (`chorus-core/DECISION-PRIMITIVE.md`), banded as a
  decision: a strict sort auto-seats (🟢), a tie at the cap seats a recorded default +
  async override (🟡) — never an operator interruption, never orchestrator lens-merit
  judgment (D1). **Exceptional entries** are additive and uncapped but **evidence-anchored**
  (cite an uncovered delta or be refused, I8/D5; distinct deltas; no adjudicator); the board
  never exceeds the roster, and an exceptional seat is a voice, not weight. Out-seat coverage
  is judged by mandate, never by overlapping findings; the scope/deferral lens secures
  its seat by **exceptional entry** (the always-uncovered cut delta on a new buildout),
  not a bespoke carve-out, and a new-buildout gate seated without it is **side-noted**,
  not auto-seated. (Extends I2; the decision discipline is
  `chorus-core/DECISION-PRIMITIVE.md`, D1–D5.)
- **S4.** No gate passes with an open 🔴; each 🔴 is resolved or waived with
  recorded rationale. (Extends I7.)
- **S5.** Incorporation revises the spec and regenerates downstream artefacts via
  the speckit phase-runner; no downstream artefact is hand-patched. (Extends
  I1/I6.)
- **S6.** Every counted finding satisfies the I8 evidence gate (file:line or a
  principle tag); the rest are demoted and excluded from the tally. (Extends I8.)
- **S7.** No gate loop runs past 3 cycles; the third uncleared cycle escalates to
  the operator.

## The ledger

Each run writes a per-feature ledger at `specs/<feature>/agent-sdlc-log.md`,
appended once per gate execution. It is the audit trail proving each gate fired
honestly — a reviewer must be able to reconstruct the run from it alone. Schema:
RSVP table (joiners/abstainers + the two-axis signal), findings register, vote
tally, 🔴 resolution/waiver log, unclaimed extract records, loop-cycle count, a
**`## Provisional decisions (review & override)`** section holding the 🟡
DecisionRecords (default, runner-up, sensor evidence, override + cost — see
`chorus-core/DECISION-PRIMITIVE.md`), a **`## Memory update (sign-off)`** section
(per-persona write-back counts, the proposed `project-wide` diff or its locator, the
operator accept/reject/deferred decision, the pending-proposals list, and any
secret-filter drops — spec 010 FR-008), and the end-of-run **S1–S9 self-audit
checklist** (each item marked pass with a pointer to its evidence row). The ledger is
**not** placed under `docs/reviews/` — that directory is for periodic project-state
rounds. (Full schema: `specs/003-agent-sdlc-workflow/contracts/sdlc-ledger.md`;
decision-record schema: `chorus-core/DECISION-PRIMITIVE.md`.)

## Refusals (lifecycle boundaries)

The SDLC orchestrator refuses, plainly, to (the mode-independent refusal catalog
is in `chorus-core/CONDUCTOR.md`; these are the lifecycle-specific ones):

- **Author an artefact.** It invokes the phase-runner; it does not write the
  spec, plan, tasks, or code (S1).
- **Pass a 🔴 silently** or override the operator on ambers (S4).
- **Synthesize a vote** or let an author grade its own finding (S8/S9, via the
  primitive).
- **Hand-patch a downstream artefact** instead of clarifying the spec (S5).
- **Loop forever.** Three uncleared cycles escalate (S7).
- **Treat a fixed viewpoint as authoritative.** `spec-walkthrough` is an input,
  not a gate (FR-018).
- **Auto-write the shared addendum, or author a persona's memory.** At sign-off the
  memory update phase *dispatches* the write-back to each persona; the operator owns
  the addendum, written only via an accepted, scope-tagged proposal (S1/S9, spec 010).
