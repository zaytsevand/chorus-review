# chorus-review

A Claude Code skill that runs a structured multi-advisor review of **whatever
you point it at** — most often a spec or a feature's design, occasionally a
full-codebase sweep. Nine persona advisors, each reviewing the target through
their lens:

- **Eric Evans** — DDD / domain model
- **Mark Richards** — architecture & evolvability
- **Alan Cooper** — adversarial product
- **Don Norman** — human-centred design
- **Uncle Bob** — clean code / SOLID
- **Kent Beck** — TDD / simple design
- **Delivery-and-Ops** — synthesized (Farley · Hightower · Majors)
- **Security-and-Trust** — synthesized (Schneier · Shostack · Nather)
- **Goldratt** — Eliyahu M. Goldratt (Theory of Constraints; deferral / opportunity cost), modernized by Reinertsen flow economics

An optional **Guido** (Python) language lens joins only on rounds with Python in
scope. Conflicts go to `advisor()`. Output is a durable markdown artifact you
commit; the most recent artifact is the next round's baseline.

## The suite — three skills over one substrate

The chorus is packaged as a **composable suite** of three skills. The shared
mechanics live once in a substrate skill; the two operator-facing modes compose
it by name and never depend on each other:

- **`chorus-core`** — substrate (not invoked directly). The four-stage gate
  primitive (`skill/chorus-core/GATE-PRIMITIVE.md`: extract → uncapped author →
  real adversarial vote → deterministic tally), the decision primitive
  (`DECISION-PRIMITIVE.md`), the exploratory phase (`EXPLORATORY-PHASE.md`), and
  the conductor discipline + the single `I1–I9` invariant catalog
  (`CONDUCTOR.md`). It also documents the **reserved seams** (extract-stage
  record, agent-memory layout, two-tier memory model) and the **findings→memory
  contract** future skills compose.
- **`chorus-review`** — the **project-state round**: a multi-lens review of a
  scope you choose (most often a spec or a feature's design; occasionally the
  whole codebase). Trigger: **"spawn the chorus."** Output:
  `docs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-chorus-review.md`.
- **`chorus-sdlc`** — the **agent-SDLC lifecycle**: three scoped chorus gates
  over a single feature as it moves through plan → tasks → implement (design
  review after `plan`, plan/tasks review after `tasks`, implementation review
  after `implement`). Each gate is RSVP-scoped, capped at five lenses, and blocks
  the pipeline only on an unresolved 🔴. Trigger: **"run the agent-SDLC on
  feature 0NN."** Output: `specs/<feature>/agent-sdlc-log.md`.
  It also exposes **`chorus challenge`** — Gate A's **premise pass** run
  standalone, grilling a target's premise (problem / necessity-now / framing /
  load-bearing assumptions) and steelmanning the null or an alternative, on any
  spec, design note, or raw idea. Same brief, fixed red-team checklist, and
  substantive honest-null, defined once in `skill/chorus-sdlc/SKILL.md`
  (§ Gate A — premise pass); the same pass runs first inside every Gate A.
  Trigger: **"chorus challenge `<target>`."**

Both modes run the **same** gate primitive from `chorus-core`, so they cannot
drift. Each sibling declares `REQUIRED: chorus-core` and carries a sibling-side
guard that fails loudly if the substrate is absent. The rest of this README
describes the project-state round (`chorus-review`).

## Why

Two patterns this skill is built to resist:

- **Findings dominated by legacy code.** Without an exclusion gate, every
  review collapses onto the same tech-debt directory and crowds out signal
  from the actively-developed surface. The skill's Phase-0 scope-exclusion
  gate prevents this by baking the project's "do not produce findings about
  these paths" list into every persona brief.
- **Findings without scaffolding.** The artifact is a durable baseline; the
  next round assumes its top-5 either closed or explicitly carried forward.
  Without that discipline, every chorus re-derives the same blockers.

Two design choices worth knowing about:

- **RSVP per round.** Personas self-select into each round based on the
  since-last-chorus deltas. Quorum is odd (3 or 5) to avoid 2-vs-2
  deadlocks. If too few join, the round aborts honestly rather than fake a
  chorus.
- **Dijkstra-grounded integration layer.** The session running the skill is
  a thin orchestrator with explicit refusals — it routes between personas,
  the user, and `advisor()`, but never holds a lens, never adds findings of
  its own, never substitutes `advisor()` for cognitive work. See
  `skill/chorus-review/INTEGRATION-LAYER.md`.

The integration layer (the calling session) is a thin orchestrator. It routes
between personas, the user, and `advisor()`, but never holds a lens, never
adds findings of its own, and never substitutes `advisor()` for cognitive
work. The invariants enforcing that — including the **I8 evidence gate** the
diagram references — live in
[`skill/chorus-review/INTEGRATION-LAYER.md`](skill/chorus-review/INTEGRATION-LAYER.md).

Before Round 1, participating advisors run the **exploratory phase**: each builds
and persists a lens-specific understanding of the target, harvested
reference-first over a **two-tier memory** — the operator-owned
`CHORUS-PROJECT.md` addendum as the authoritative project base, plus thin
per-advisor records that may cache from it. Persisted memory is an index of
locators, never a finding's evidentiary endpoint — findings re-ground in the live
material. The mechanic lives in
[`skill/chorus-core/EXPLORATORY-PHASE.md`](skill/chorus-core/EXPLORATORY-PHASE.md).

## Principles

The chorus is a procedure for surfacing trade-offs. It is not a substitute
for the engineering principles a project anchors trade-offs against. Three
cross-cutting concerns recur across every lens — they aren't a separate
doctrine layered on top of the personas, they're how each persona
*already* reads code through their own vocabulary:

| Concern | Cooper / Norman read it as | Evans reads it as | Richards reads it as | Beck reads it as | Uncle Bob reads it as | Delivery-and-Ops reads it as | Security-and-Trust reads it as | Goldratt reads it as |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Interface contracts** | a promise the user can read | Published Language at a bounded-context boundary | the coupling-type decision at the seam | making the change easy before making the easy change | Dependency Inversion at the architectural seam | the surface a smoke test, canary, or rollback gate can assert against | the trust boundary — what crosses it, who's authoritative, what's enforced | the hypothesis the work is betting on — the boundary past which a non-constraint may be subordinated |
| **Local purity / explicit effects** | hidden cost shifted onto the user | a Domain Event the model refuses to acknowledge | undocumented temporal or content coupling | a function that can't be cornered by a unit test | SRP and the principle of least astonishment, from two angles | three failure modes presented as one — blast radius compounds silently | a hidden grant of capability the threat model never accounted for | a deferral whose downstream cost is hidden — opportunity cost that must be priced, not buried |
| **Behavioural assertions** | a promise nobody is keeping | an aggregate invariant nobody enforces | the cheapest fitness function | the red of red-green-refactor | a blocker, not a nit | the cheapest signal — the CI gate you can afford | a threat-model claim with no test = security theatre | a defer/cut claim with no settling experiment — an opinion, not a finding |

Each persona carries these as their own concerns in their own voice — see
the agent files under [`agents/`](agents/). Optional language lenses carry the
same three concerns in their language's grain — e.g. Guido (Python): an unsigned
type-hint contract, a mutable-default side effect, an idiom claim no type or test
can pin (`agents/guido-python-reviewer.md`). When two lenses independently judge a
finding **under-rated** (the `PRIORITIZE` vote) in a chorus round, it escalates one
severity level. Mere agreement at the proposed severity (the `CONFIRM` vote) counts as
convergence for *ranking* but does not escalate — so popular polish stays polish.
(Vote vocabulary `PRIORITIZE` / `CONFIRM` / `OVER-RATE`; see `skill/chorus-core/GATE-PRIMITIVE.md`.)

Projects with stronger or more-specific principles (layer rules, language
mandates, infrastructure constraints) declare them in section 4 of
[`templates/CHORUS-PROJECT.template.md`](templates/CHORUS-PROJECT.template.md)
under "Constitutional / governance principles." Phase 4 ranking consumes
that list under "Constitutional ROI."

Findings cite either `file:line` (claims about the project's artefacts)
or `[principle]` (claims grounded in a project-named principle the
addendum carries). The I8 evidence gate refuses findings that do
neither — see [`skill/chorus-review/INTEGRATION-LAYER.md`](skill/chorus-review/INTEGRATION-LAYER.md).

## Lens coverage

Which agent owns which axis. Score per cell: **3** primary remit · **2**
secondary strength · **1** incidental · `·` none. A column with no `3` is an
axis no single lens owns — structurally under-represented.

|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|

| **Champion? (any 3)** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |

**Axis key:** **Dom** Domain modeling · **Arch** Architecture & evolvability ·
**Craft** Code craft & maintainability · **Test** Testing & correctness ·
**UX** Human / UX & usability · **Prod** Product value & user goals ·
**Prio** Prioritization, deferral & cost · **Deliv** Delivery & operability ·
**Obs** Observability & prod feedback · **Sec** Security & trust ·
**Perf** Performance & efficiency · **Data** Data integrity & persistence.

Two axes — **Performance** and **Data integrity** — have no champion: they are
covered only as a side effect of other remits (Richards on performance; Evans
and Security-and-Trust on data). If neither of those lenses RSVPs into a round,
the axis goes dark. Optional language lenses (e.g. Guido for Python) layer their
own grain on top per language and aren't scored here. The live, interactive
version of this matrix — heatmap, radar, and per-axis breakdown — is at
[`docs/reviews/2026-06-05-chorus-coverage-map.html`](docs/reviews/2026-06-05-chorus-coverage-map.html).

## Install

### Canonical (clone + script)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/chorus-review.git
cd chorus-review
./install.sh
```

This iterates over `skill/*/` and copies all three suite skills
(`chorus-core`, `chorus-review`, `chorus-sdlc`) into `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`
and the persona agents into `~/.claude/agents/`. Existing same-named agent files
are preserved unless you pass `--force`.

Override the target with `CLAUDE_HOME=/path/to/claude ./install.sh`.

#### Upgrading from the pre-suite single skill (REQUIRED manual step — F6 waiver)

The pre-split install put all files in one `chorus-review/` dir. `install.sh`
does **not** prune stale files (the installer-prune fix was waived in favor of a
documented manual step). A copy-only re-install would leave orphaned files
(`SDLC-LAYER.md`, the primitives, the old `SKILL.md`) that **double-define the
`I1–I9` catalog** in the live dir. Before re-installing the suite, delete the old
single-skill dir:

```sh
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/chorus-review   # remove the pre-suite single-skill install
./install.sh                            # then install the suite fresh
```

This is the operator-accepted mitigation; the repo source is unaffected (the
invariant-resolution fitness check runs on source).

### Plugin (Claude Code plugin manifest)

The repo ships a `plugin.json` so it can be loaded via Claude Code's plugin
mechanism. See your Claude Code version's plugin-installation docs for the
exact incantation; the manifest at the root is the canonical entry point.

> **Naming reconciliation (recorded, not yet actioned — FR-016).** The review
> skill is published in some environments under the trigger name `chorus` while
> its source skill dir is `chorus-review`. This mismatch is **recorded as an
> explicit reconciliation task**; it is **not** silently renamed here. Resolve it
> deliberately (decide the canonical published name, then align source + manifest
> + docs in one change) rather than letting the two drift.

### Uninstall

```sh
./uninstall.sh
```

Removes the three suite skill dirs and the persona agent files. Your per-project
addenda and chorus artifacts under `docs/reviews/` are left untouched.

## Run a round

1. **Drop the template into your project:**

   ```sh
   cp ~/code/chorus-review/templates/CHORUS-PROJECT.template.md \
      docs/reviews/CHORUS-PROJECT.md
   ```

2. **Edit it.** Sections 2 (exclusions), 3 (anchor surface), and 5
   (project-specific security checklist) are required before the chorus can
   launch. The skill will interview you inline if the file is missing or
   incomplete, but a filled-in addendum makes every round faster.

3. **In Claude Code, say:**

   > spawn the chorus

   The orchestrator will load the addendum, confirm the scope-exclusion list
   with you, draft the round-context paragraph (deltas since the last
   round), and run the RSVP gate. Each persona that joins produces a Round 1
   report; cross-evaluation, conflict reconciliation via `advisor()`,
   ranking, and security follow. The final artifact lands at
   `docs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-chorus-review.md`. Commit it.

## What you get

A markdown artifact structured as:

- Roster (this round) — joiners, abstainers, why.
- Findings register — every finding `F1`, `F2`, … with severity, lens,
  target, one-sentence summary.
- Consolidation matrix — for ranking and scoring.
- Round briefs — what each round produced as a whole.
- Phase 3 conflict reconciliation — every `Cn`, what was disputed, how it
  was settled.
- Top-5 ranked recommendations — scored on Cost / Value / Convergence
  (and Constitutional ROI if your project has a governance doc).
- Pre-public-rollout gate — any 🔴 blockers tracked as a unit.
- TL;DR — three sentences at the top.
- Next-chorus baseline — what the next round should assume closed.

## When NOT to use this

- Single-lens questions — just spawn the relevant persona agent directly.
- Line-by-line review of a PR diff — use a dedicated code-review tool; the
  chorus reviews specs and design, not diffs.
- One-off architecture questions — invoke `mark-richards-architect` solo.

The chorus is usually pointed at a spec or a feature's design; a full-codebase
sweep is the occasional periodic case, not the default. For the full sweep,
cadence is typically quarterly or after a major release.
